# Project Memory Map — Group Planning Assistant Backend

*The living map of this project. Updated in the same session as any
architectural change (roadmap §3). Ground truth for design: the
team roadmap `GROUP_PLANNING_ASSISTANT_PYTHON_BACKEND_ROADMAP_2026-10-24.md`
in the goal files; the docs set (18 documents) travels with it.*

## What this is

The Python backend for the Group Planning Assistant (Meta Global AI
Developer Hackathon team entry; build window Oct 26 → Nov 4, 2026).
Volmarr + Yrsa build the backend; Geoffrey + Henry build the
frontend against `OPENAPI.json`. Releases travel as ZIPs on the
roadmap's train (ZIP-0 → Alpha → Beta → RC → Final).

## How to run / how to test

```sh
uv sync --extra dev     # install the exact locked environment
./run.sh                # server on http://127.0.0.1:8000  (--demo seeds first)
./test.sh               # full pytest suite + one-page report
uv run alembic upgrade head   # migration path (GPA_DATABASE_URL)
```

Verified 2026-10-24: fresh `uv sync` → `./run.sh` → `/health` ok;
Alembic up/down/up clean; **92 tests, all passing**.

## Slice status

### Phase 0 — Foundation (B-001 → B-010): COMPLETE
- B-001 repo+tooling (uv lockfile committed, run.sh/run.ps1 parity,
  protective .gitignore) · B-002 create_app + pydantic-settings
  (GPA_ prefix, prod refuses dev secret in plain words) + JSON/text
  structured logging + request-id middleware · B-003 SQLite WAL +
  synchronous=FULL + foreign_keys=ON + busy_timeout on every
  connection; Alembic wired; migration 0001_initial · B-004
  problem+json chassis + ERROR_CODES registry in errors.py · B-005
  pytest chassis + test.sh one-page report · B-006 export_openapi.py
  + generate_ts_types.py + snapshot contract test · B-007 storage
  protocol + local sha256 content-addressed driver (atomic writes,
  strict key pattern = traversal-proof) · B-008 job chassis
  (enqueue/claim-by-update/backoff/dead-letter, GET /jobs/{id},
  standalone `gpa-worker`) · B-009 idempotent seed loader (natural
  keys) · B-010 health+meta, demo seed (1 group + 1 user),
  make_release_zip.py → **ZIP-0 built** (releases/, sha256 sidecar),
  Bruno skeleton (bruno.json + health.bru + local env).

### Phase 1 — Identity, groups, permissions (B-011 → B-022): COMPLETE
- B-011 users + Argon2id (see Decisions) · B-012 magic links
  (hashed, 30-min, single-use, dev mail = file outbox in
  services/mail.py) · B-013 sessions: hand-rolled HS256 JWT access
  (15 min) + rotating refresh families, reuse-of-old revokes the
  family · B-014 API keys (hashed, prefix shown, scopes
  read/draft/publish/admin, last-used) · B-015 groups + slug
  collisions + private-group 404 rule · B-016 memberships: invite
  (creates claimable passwordless account), accept/decline, role
  changes (owner-only for owner/admin moves), last-owner rule ·
  B-017 deps.py is the only door (require_group_role /
  require_scope); verified: **no router imports any model** ·
  B-018 agent seats: seat keys, seat audit labels, candidate stub —
  seat can draft, can never approve (403 seat_cannot_approve,
  enforced in the service) · B-019 append-only audit, same-transaction
  writer, GET /groups/{id}/audit (admin+) · B-020 password reset +
  password change + email change (token to the NEW address); all
  revoke existing sessions · B-021 per-IP token-bucket on auth
  routes, 429 + Retry-After · B-022 role-matrix suite green
  (tests/test_permissions.py: 5 roles × 8 actions, parametrized).

### Later phases: NOT STARTED (per roadmap order)
Phase 2 sources/ingest is next. The `Candidate` model and
`FileAsset` table are Phase 1 stubs sized for Phase 2/3 growth.

## Decisions & deviations (from the roadmap defaults)

- **Password hashing: argon2-cffi** (the roadmap allowed pwdlib or
  argon2-cffi; chose the direct reference binding — fewer layers,
  Argon2id via PasswordHasher defaults). Recorded here per B-011.
- **JWT: implemented in-house** on stdlib hmac/hashlib (security.py)
  instead of adding PyJWT — the format is three base64url parts and
  an HMAC; owning it keeps the dependency list exactly the
  roadmap's and the behaviour fully testable (D-46 spirit).
- **Email validation: in-house** small validator
  (services/identity.normalize_email) instead of pydantic EmailStr,
  which would have required the extra email-validator package.
- **Initial Alembic migration** builds from model metadata
  (create_all/drop_all) rather than op-by-op DDL — at revision 0001
  the models are the reviewed schema; later migrations are
  hand-written as usual. Noted in the migration file itself.
- **Seats' group context**: an invited (not yet active) person can
  reach a private group with role=None so accept/decline works;
  everyone else gets the 404. Implemented in deps.get_group_context.
- Test suite takes ~1 minute, almost all of it Argon2 hashing in
  registrations — acceptable; revisit only if it slows the train.

## Standing laws in force here

- No Docker, anywhere, ever (native installs + uv only).
- All code is the team's own original work (D-46); third-party
  software enters only as installed, locked dependencies.
- Licence: **undecided** — "Licence: to be decided by the team — all
  rights reserved." No file may presume one (no licence field in
  pyproject, no classifiers). Business/licence decisions rest with
  Geoffrey & Henry.
- Commit-before-answer (services commit, then routers respond);
  entered data is sacred (WAL + FULL).
- Heavy plain-words comments (D-26): header on every file,
  docstrings everywhere.
- Local git commits only. No remote, no push, ever, unless Volmarr
  says otherwise in so many words.
